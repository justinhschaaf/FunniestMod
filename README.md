# The Funniest Minecraft Mod

This was a simple Bukkit/Spigot/Paper plugin I made to use in a video on [my YouTube channel](http://yt.justinhs.ch), aptly titled ["The Funniest Minecraft Mod Makes Minecraft 1000x Funnier"](https://youtu.be/OMq66k2imLQ). This plugin makes anvils launch out of the player and fall down to bedrock, all zombies spawn as babies fully equipped in Netherite armor, all skeletons spawn with Punch X bows, all mobs explode upon death based on their maximum health, and all blocks explode randomly when broken. Good luck beating the game with this. Downloads available under the "Releases" tab. Enable it with the `/togglefunniest` command.
